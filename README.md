# foodtrack
A web application that tries to simulate home food management.

I've built my first web application as my final project of Harvard's CS50x online course I took on edx.org.
Technologies I used: Flask, Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML with Bootstrap

User can : 
1) Add, edit or remove ingredients in their "fridge" or "kitchen" so to speak.
2) Add or remove recipes with data such as : title, photo of the dish, portions per recipe, ingredients necessary to make the dish and tips.
3) Add, edit or remove shopping lists consisting of ingredients to buy.

All of this data is kept using sqlite3 database which I connect to via CS50's very own sql library (sort of training wheels for now).
